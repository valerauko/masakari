# Masakari

Tool to detect unused entries in your dictionary files.

## Usage

Download `masakari` executable from releases. Execute.

```
masakari /path/to/folder/to/check
```

If you omit the path argument it will use the current folder (`.`).

## Limitations

Currently only works with Vue.js code and JSON dictionary files. It assumes that every JSON file is a dictionary.
